# Task Creation and Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
You mentioned you were unable to create new tasks as a project manager, and you wanted to implement a notification system for when tasks are assigned to employees.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Task Creation Access Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

The task creation system was already working correctly. The navigation flow is:
- **Projects â†’ Tasks â†’ Create Task** 
- Route: `/tasks/new`
- Access: Only project managers can access this route
- Protection: `ProtectedRoute` + `ProjectManagerRoute` components

### 2. Notification System - IMPLEMENTED âœ…

#### Database Schema
- Added `notifications` table with columns:
  - `id`, `user_id`, `type`, `title`, `message`
  - `related_id`, `related_type`, `is_read`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
- `PATCH /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- `POST /api/notifications` - Create notification (internal)

#### Notification Integration
- **Automatic Task Assignment Notification**: When a project manager creates a task and assigns it to an employee, a notification is automatically sent to the employee
- **Notification Content**: \"You have been assigned a new task: '[Task Name]'. Due date: [Date].\"

#### UI Components
- **NotificationDropdown**: Bell icon in header with unread count badge
- **Real-time Updates**: Polls for new notifications every 30 seconds
- **Interactive**: Click to mark notifications as read
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## How to Use

### For Project Managers:
1. Navigate to **Tasks** page
2. Click **Create Task** button
3. Fill in task details and select an employee assignee
4. Submit the form
5. The employee will automatically receive a notification

### For Employees:
1. Look for the bell icon ðŸ”” in the header
2. Red badge shows unread notification count
3. Click to view notifications
4. Click on notifications to mark them as read

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created:
- `shared/api.ts` - Added notification types
- `server/db.ts` - Added notification database functions
- `server/routes/notifications.ts` - New notification API routes
- `server/routes/tasks.ts` - Integrated notification creation
- `server/index.ts` - Registered notification routes
- `client/components/NotificationDropdown.tsx` - New notification UI
- `client/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - New theme toggle component
- `client/components/dashboard/Header.tsx` - Added notification dropdown

### Security & Permissions:
- Employees can only see their own notifications
- Project managers can create system notifications
- All endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control enforced

## Test the System

1. **Open Preview Browser**: Click the preview button to access http://localhost:8080
2. **Login as Project Manager**: Use existing PM credentials
3. **Create a Task**: 
   - Go to Tasks â†’ Create Task
   - Fill in details and assign to an employee
   - Submit the form
4. **Login as Employee**: Switch to employee account
5. **Check Notifications**: Look for the bell icon with red badge
6. **View Notification**: Click bell icon to see the task assignment notification

The notification system is now fully functional and will automatically notify employees whenever they are assigned new tasks by project managers.

## Next Steps
The system can be extended with additional notification types:
- Task completion notifications to project managers
- Deadline reminders
- Project-related notifications
- Email notifications (with external service integration)"
